# India’s Energy Transition: Renewable and Non-Renewable Energy Trends (Post-Liberalization to 2022)

## Project Overview
This project provides an analysis of India's energy trends from **post-liberalization (1991)** to **2022**, focusing on both **renewable and non-renewable energy sources**. It aims to examine how India's energy landscape has evolved over three decades, exploring key shifts in energy production, consumption, policies, and the country's transition toward a more sustainable and diversified energy mix.

## Timeline
The project spans from **1991** (the year of India’s economic liberalization) to **2022**, analyzing key changes in India's energy sector during this period:

1. **1991–2000: Early Liberalization and Energy Challenges**
   - India’s economic liberalization led to greater energy demand due to industrial growth.
   - Heavy reliance on coal and oil imports, with early attempts at diversification.
   - Growth in electricity generation from coal-fired plants, but also some progress in hydropower.

2. **2001–2010: Renewable Energy Initiatives Begin**
   - Introduction of policies to promote renewable energy sources, particularly wind and solar.
   - The launch of programs like the **National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC)** in 2008.
   - Continued dependence on non-renewable sources like coal and oil, but renewable energy starts gaining momentum.

3. **2011–2020: Rapid Expansion of Renewable Energy**
   - Major investments in solar and wind energy, especially after 2015.
   - India becomes one of the world’s largest renewable energy markets.
   - Policies like **Ujjwala Yojana** (clean cooking) and **Smart Grid** development.
   - The government sets ambitious targets, including 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022.

4. **2021–2022: Achievements and Future Outlook**
   - Achieved a significant milestone in renewable energy capacity, particularly solar and wind.
   - Continuing energy reforms, smart grids, and cleaner energy initiatives.
   - Set a new target of **500 GW of non-fossil fuel energy capacity by 2030**.
   - The rise in electric vehicles (EV) and green hydrogen investments.
   - The push for energy storage and grid modernization to accommodate renewables.
